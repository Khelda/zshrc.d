# Artworks used

Since my neofetch and onefetch configuration files uses illustrations, I decided to be as lazy as I possibly could and threw them in here. They are all labeled with the same names as the respective configurations use, however, I do not claim any ownership of these, they are only here to make my life easier.

## Authors list

Here lies the list of which artist I borrowed work from to use as custom icons. If you're one of them and you're not fine with this (or I messed up when quoting you), please contact me, we can work something out to fix this situation, I do not bite.
