# Artworks used

Since my neofetch and onefetch configuration files uses illustrations, I decided to be as lazy as I possibly could and threw them in here. They are all labeled with the same names as the respective configurations use, however, I do not claim any ownership of these, they are only here to make my life easier.

## Authors list

Here lies the list of which artist I borrowed work from to use as custom icons. If you're one of them and you're not fine with this, please contact me, we can work something out to fix this situation.
