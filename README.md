# My personal zsh (and other) config

## Try it out!

That's right! You can take my zsh configuration for a spin _right now_, without clobbering your existing configuration!

Just clone this repository and run the `zsh` script at its root!

## Install it

This repository contains an ordered set of loadable zsh scripts. In order to install it, you need to add the lines contained in `zshrc.template` to your own `.zshrc`, making sure to have `ZSH_CONFIG_PATH` pointing to this repository.

This configuration works best with Nix, kitty and [my Neovim config](https://cloud.thesola.io/git/thesola10/nvim-config), but those are not hard requirements. You can also import the `zsh` package in this Nix flake into your NixOS configuration.

# Artworks used

Since my neofetch and onefetch configuration files uses illustrations, I decided to be as lazy as I possibly could and threw them in here. They are all labeled with the same names as the respective configurations use, however, I do not claim any ownership of these, they are only here to make my life easier.
